# Facial_Emotion_Recognition
This project trains a neural network on the data and recognizes the facial expressions of the user among the 7 emotions:
<ul>
  <li>Anger</li>
  <li>Contempt</li>
  <li>Disgust</li>
  <li>Fear</li>
  <li>Happy</li>
  <li>Sadness</li>
  <li>Surprise</li>
</ul>

The `Emotion_Recognition.ipynb` file contains the training part of the project because the neural network was trained on a Google Colab notebook for faster training with its GPU. 

`CK+48.zip` contains the image data on which the model is trained. 

`main.py` uses the trained model to recognise the emotion.
